Additionally, the iridium-catalyzed reaction of tertiary amides with TMDS is tolerant of ketone and ester groups to prepare easily the corresponding functionalized aldenamines (Ref2019 pages 1-2). Furthermore, a green and sustainable oxime ether formation method via the visible-light-promoted O −H functionalization of oximes with diazo esters is described, occurring under very mild conditions (catalyst- and additive-free) with a high yield and a high functional group tolerance (Ref2021 pages 1-1). Finally, the synthesis and properties of degradable gels and porous polymers including acetal group in the network structure by addition reaction of multi-functional phenols and divinyl ether compounds is discussed (Naofumi5631 pages 14-15).
