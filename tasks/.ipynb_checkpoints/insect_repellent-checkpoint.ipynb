It is detected by olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) housed in trichoid sensilla on the antennae of mosquitoes (Zainulabeuddin1359 pages 2-2). DEET modulates the physiological response of lactic acid-sensitive olfactory receptor neurons in the antennae of the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti (Zainulabeuddin1359 pages 1-1).

      "To plan the synthesis of an insect repellent, we will focus on creating a compound similar to DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide), which is one of the most widely used and effective insect repellents. The synthesis of DEET involves a two-step process:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Preparation of m-toluoyl chloride:\n",
      "First, we need to prepare m-toluoyl chloride, which is an intermediate compound in the synthesis of DEET. This can be done by reacting m-toluic acid (3-methylbenzoic acid) with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) in the presence of a catalytic amount of dimethylformamide (DMF). The reaction takes place under reflux conditions, and the excess thionyl chloride is removed by distillation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reaction:\n",
      "m-toluic acid + SOCl2 → m-toluoyl chloride + SO2 + HCl\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Formation of DEET:\n",
      "Next, we will react the m-toluoyl chloride with diethylamine (Et2NH) to form DEET. This reaction is an amide coupling reaction, where the amine group of diethylamine reacts with the acyl chloride group of m-toluoyl chloride to form an amide bond. The reaction is typically carried out in an anhydrous solvent, such as dichloromethane (DCM), at low temperatures to minimize side reactions.\n",

      "Reaction:\n",
      "m-toluoyl chloride + Et2NH → DEET + HCl\n",
      "\n",
      "After the reaction is complete, the product can be purified by washing with water to remove any unreacted diethylamine and HCl, followed by drying and recrystallization or distillation to obtain pure DEET.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note that the synthesis of DEET should be carried out in a well-ventilated area or a fume hood, as some of the chemicals involved are toxic and can produce harmful vapors. Additionally, proper personal protective equipment, such as gloves and goggles, should be worn during the synthesis process.\n"
