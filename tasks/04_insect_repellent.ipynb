      "To synthesize an insect repellent, we can choose N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET) as our target compound, which is a widely used and effective insect repellent. The synthesis of DEET can be achieved through the reaction of m-toluic acid with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) to form m-toluoyl chloride, followed by the reaction with diethylamine (Et2NH) to produce DEET.\n",
